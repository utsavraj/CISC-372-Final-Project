# CISC 372: Final Project

## Notes on Project Design
* Using Logistic Regression and Deep Neural Decision Trees
  * Naive Bayes is not used because

## Feedback of Project Proposal
Very well-motivated project. Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to meet in person. But if needed, we can have a online video meeting.

Overall it looks good. The problem is clearly defined as well as the evaluation metric. Evaluation metrics are good. For weighted F1 you may want to use macro-weighted like we did in assignment #1. Besides of classification, would you consider also do clustering etc for the project? Another thing to pay attention to is, in this project, we need to show what distinguishes your project from what the other people have been doing. Is this a new problem? Are you solving this in a new way? What is new about this that you can say when you pitch your work? I think you can extend more discussions on those points in the final report. Good Luck!

## Answers to our questions
Not necessary random, but mostly limited by what you want to achieve. If you just want to do classification, then what type is the data? Any need for explainability? Other than that, is the data set very noisy so you need a model that has a better control on regularization? So there are conditions or characteristics that typically serve as a starting point.

## Other details
### Give a presentation and submit slides.
* Submit a softcopy of your slides on OnQ before the presentation class.
* Every team has 10 minutes (8 minutes for presentation, and 2 minutes for Q&A). You need to explain what you have done in the project as a story, including the problem description, challenges, method, experimental results, etc.
* The presentation order will be randomized.

### Submit your final report.
* Submit the link to your GitHub repository through OnQ (only latest commit before deadline will be evaluated) that contains your code, links to the dataset (or you can upload datasets on the Release tab), the slides, and the final report in PDF or Word.
* [Report] The report is limited to 12 pages. The report may contain the following sections:
  * Abstract â€“ 4 sentence summary (not more, not less, exactly 4)
  * Introduction:
    * Try to motivate the research problem using a real-world scenario.
    * Informal description of the problem. You may consider using an example to describe the problem.
    * Summarize the challenges and contributions/impact of the paper.
  * Problem Statement
    * Clearly define your problem.
  * Proposed Method or Solution
    * An overview of your solution.
    * Detailed steps of your solution.
  * Experimental Results (if any)
  * Summary or Conclusions

### Evaluation criteria
* Originality, scientific contributions, and impact
  * Are you solving a new problem? What are the strengths of your proposed solution?
  * If some materials in your paper and source code come from other papers, books, and any other sources, you must cite them properly.
* Correctness of applied methodology
  * Are you using the right DM method for the intended objective?
* Experimental results, findings, conclusions
  * Show and explain the experimental results. Provide an analytical explanation of the results, regardless it is good or bad. Show your effort. Is the actual result same as what you have expected? If the result is bad, say with low accuracy, do you have any suggestions to improve it? It is fine to show bad results. You will not get a lower mark because of showing bad results.
* Clarity of the final report
* Challenges of the proposed problem: The instructor will compare the level of difficulty of your project with other teams.
