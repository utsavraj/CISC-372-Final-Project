# CISC-372-Final-Project

## FeedBack of Project Proposal
Very well-motivated project. Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to meet in person. But if needed, we can have a online video meeting.

Overall it looks good. The problem is clearly defined as well as the evaluation metric. Evaluation metrics are good. For weighted F1 you may want to use macro-weighted like we did in assignment #1. Besides of classification, would you consider also do clustering etc for the project? Another thing to pay attention to is, in this project, we need to show what distinguishes your project from what the other people have been doing. Is this a new problem? Are you solving this in a new way? What is new about this that you can say when you pitch your work? I think you can extend more discussions on those points in the final report. Good Luck!

## Feedback on our questions
Not necessary random, but mostly limited by what you want to achieve. If you just want to do classification, then what type is the data? Any need for explainability? Other than that, is the data set very noisy so you need a model that has a better control on regularization? So there are conditions or characteristics that typically serve as a starting point.
